# practical-numpy

Some practical NumPy applications using Jupyter notebooks supplemented with supporting modules as needed

Modules that are used to supplement the demo applications are:
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pillow

## Introduction

A short description about each notebook is given below:

1. Dimensionality: shows SVD (singular value decomposition) over 2D grayscale image obtained from an RGB image and n-dimensional array derived from 3-channel RGB image.

2. Portability: shows simplistic way of exchanging NumPy data across machines using compressed and non-compressed file formats which covers most of the use cases in practice.
