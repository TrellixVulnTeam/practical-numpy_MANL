# practical-numpy

Some practical NumPy applications using Jupyter notebooks supplemented with supporting modules as needed

Modules that are used to supplement the demo applications are:
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pillow

A short description about each notebook is given below:

1. Dimensionality: shows SVD (singular value decomposition) over n-dimensional array derived from 3-channel RGB image.
